----bugs----
-Using Thing ability on grass will crash the game. To be fixed after the NPC/Player rework.

----features----

-NPC/Player rework. NPCs and Player should have the same parent, so that their interactions with the environment will be the same.

-Use SRP interface style to make an interface for the monsters/NPCs. Perhaps use a GetNode to get the WanderController.

-Ability will need a field for its author. So friendly casted abilities only hit enemies and enemy casted abilities will only hit friendlies.
